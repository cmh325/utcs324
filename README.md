My Assignments for CS 342 Fall 2017 UTexas 

#Assignment 1: Estimation of pi

#Assignment 2: Linear and simple non-linear classifier to predict whether a point lies within a circle

#Assignment 3: Fully connected classifier to predict classes on supertux with different loss functions

#Assignment 4: CNN classifier (5 conv layers, 1pool layers and n_param<100,000) to predict classes on supertux 

#Assignment 5: CNN classifier with techniques to prevent overfitting (5 conv layers, 1pool layers and n_param<100,000). Techniques : data augmentation, dropout, weight regularization

#Assignment 6: Deep (20+ layer) CNN classifier with: batch norm and resnet to seep up training (n_param<500k)

#Assignment 7: Implement a fully convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation of images with skip connections acc to Long(2016). Implementation of tf dataset, iterator, and uneven loss function weighting
